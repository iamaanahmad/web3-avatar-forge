- Avatar Trait System: Define trait categories (e.g., hair, eyes, accessories). Support rarity levels and trait packs. Allow community-contributed trait sets via GitHub.
- Developer Docs & Examples: Usage guide for React components. Sample integration in a dApp. API reference for metadata and wallet linking.
- Theme & Branding Support: Allow projects to inject custom themes or brand overlays. Support DAO badges, seasonal traits, or game-specific skins.
- Demo Playground: Create a hosted demo where devs can build avatars, preview metadata, and simulate wallet linking. Include a “Copy Code” feature to export avatar config as JSON or JSX.
- Trait Pack Marketplace (Future Phase): Allow contributors to submit trait packs (e.g., Cyberpunk, Fantasy, DAO-themed). Enable devs to import packs via GitHub or IPFS.
- Avatar Interoperability Standard: Propose a standard for avatar metadata across dApps. Align with existing efforts like ERC-725 or DID standards.
- Analytics & Usage Tracking: Use Firebase Analytics to track avatar builder usage, trait popularity, and export frequency. Help contributors understand what traits or features are most used.
- Localization & Accessibility: Add i18n support for global devs. Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Style Guidelines:

- The concept of user-created identities in Web3 should be bold, exciting, and novel, meriting a vibrant yet grounded color scheme, appropriate for a dark UI. Primary color: Vibrant Purple (#BE75F2) for the core identity elements.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#292B2D) creates a sophisticated and modern backdrop that makes the vibrant purple pop, complementing the theme.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) serves as an exciting accent, analogous to the primary purple, used to highlight interactive elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, computerized feel. In longer text passages, 'Inter' (sans-serif) may be used for body text.
- Use minimalist and abstract icons to represent avatar traits and customization options.
- Subtle, fluid animations for trait selection and avatar updates to enhance the user experience.
- A clean and intuitive layout with a focus on the avatar preview and customization options.
